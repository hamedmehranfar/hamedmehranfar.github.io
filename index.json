This is achieved by taking into account multiple features, such as the location of components on the infrastructure network, interdependencies between interventions, possible possession windows to execute interventions, the impact on service, failure risks, and budget. This facilitates informed decision-making and effective communication between managers. To show the usefulness of the methodology presented in the paper, two scenarios are considered: one that accounts for interdependencies between multicomponent interventions and another that does not. Currently, infrastructure managers often consider the interdependencies between interventions for the determination of intervention program, but they might neglect doing so when they deal with a complex railway network. Therefore, ignoring all interdependencies represents an extreme case where such considerations are absent. The results show that considering interdependencies improves the net benefit of executing multicomponent interventions by approximately 58%, i.e., 15 million monetary unit in the period between t=6 to t=10.\nAn example spatial-temporal overview of the first intervention group overlapped with the train timetable in the first year between t=11 and t=15 on weekly, and hourly basis respectively using asset level (a), (c), and using component level (b), (d) information ","date":1749081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1749081600,"objectID":"788a83992deeabe6ee878bfe2fca6167","permalink":"https://hamedmehranfar.github.io/publication/journal-article-7/","publishdate":"2025-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article-7/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the complex iterative process railway managers currently use to sequence necessary interventions 2-10 years in advance, which requires extensive knowledge of costs, service impacts, locations, and failure risks.

It will include the development of a new integrated train schedule – intervention planning process that enables the optimal exploitation of digital tools. This process will\nenable the use of mathematical models built using state‐of‐the‐art concepts, i.e.\nmixed integer linear programming models or heuristics to determine the optimal work to be performed at predefined times in train schedules on assets considering asset specific characteristics,\ndynamic Bayesian networks to predict the future asset states and their levels of uncertainty, and\nmultivariate Kriging to ensure correct estimates of current asset states when there are incomplete data sets,\ninclude the automated transfer of asset and intervention specific information contained in multiple databases at specific time points to facilitate the running of the mathematical models to generate idealized windows for interventions, and\ninclude the automated recalculation of the exact activities to ensure train schedule stability between the fixed windows, with increasing levels of exactitude as the windows near. STABILITY will enable a digital revolution in railway intervention planning that will help ensure both train schedule stability and the maximum use of train schedule reserves.\n","date":1579046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579046400,"objectID":"6b313b71af8afbde0d14d258251754b0","permalink":"https://hamedmehranfar.github.io/project/stability/","publishdate":"2020-01-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/stability/","section":"project","summary":"Maintaining train schedule (STABILITY) and managing time table reserves via digitalized railway intervention planning.","tags":["STABILITY","Optimisation","Estimation","Infrastructure Management","Stochastic Modelling","Railway","Failure Risks","Intervention Programs","Intervention Strategies"],"title":"STABILITY","type":"project"},{"authors":["Hamed Mehranfar","Arman Tadayon","Moein Sadeghi","Morteza Bagheri"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1563408000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563408000,"objectID":"6e8c048826a447efe7fc8fc75527cf08","permalink":"https://hamedmehranfar.github.io/publication/conference-paper-2/","publishdate":"2019-07-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper-2/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, significant factors of freight train collision severity at rail-road level crossing, have been identified using a multinomial logit model...","tags":["Railway","Safety","Statistical Analysis","Conferences"],"title":"Major Factor Affecting Freight Train Collision Severity At Road-Rail Level Crossing Using Multinomial Logit Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In this project a a digital tool was developed for improving the decision making about the taking different operation policies on how to dispatch and distribute the cargo wagon across the railway network in Iran.
