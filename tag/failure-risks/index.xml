      <title>Optimizing Multicomponent Intervention Programs Considering Costs, Interdependencies, Possession Windows, and Service Loss Risks</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;practical-applications&#34;&gt;Practical Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methodology presented in this paper enables infrastructure managers, such as network and production planners, involved in the later phases of the intervention planning process, to leverage digitalization for generating a consistent and complete overview of optimal multicomponent intervention programs. This is achieved by taking into account multiple features, such as the location of components on the infrastructure network, interdependencies between interventions, possible possession windows to execute interventions, the impact on service, failure risks, and budget. This facilitates informed decision-making and effective communication between managers. To show the usefulness of the methodology presented in the paper, two scenarios are considered: one that accounts for interdependencies between multicomponent interventions and another that does not. Currently, infrastructure managers often consider the interdependencies between interventions for the determination of intervention program, but they might neglect doing so when they deal with a complex railway network. Therefore, ignoring all interdependencies represents an extreme case where such considerations are absent. The results show that considering interdependencies improves the net benefit of executing multicomponent interventions by approximately 58%, i.e., 15 million monetary unit in the period between t=6 to t=10.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am excited to announce that I will be involved in mentoring six students in the FS2024 semester. Two of them are Master&amp;rsquo;s projects that focus on the failure risks analysis of the road infrastructure, and four of them are Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s theses that aim to estimate the financial needs to manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.szu.ch/en/welcome&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;SZU&lt;/a&gt; infrastructures. These are very important topics in infrastructure management, and I am eager to work with these students and help them achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>STABILITY</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The future of rail transport will be one where trains carrying passengers and goods flow seamlessly from their origins to their destinations. Potential disruptions due to train incidents will be foreseen with the extensive use of surveillance technologies, and either prevented through the implementation of detailed action plans or their consequences eliminated with the seamless rerouting of trains. Interventions on the infrastructure, whether it be the grinding of tracks, or expansion of train stations, will be carried out in perfectly allotted slots in train
schedules. Train schedules will be stable and the use of train schedule reserves will be maximized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STABILITY will develop tools to enable the realization of the latter part of this future. It will include the development of a new integrated train schedule – intervention planning process that enables the optimal exploitation of digital tools.
This process will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;enable the use of mathematical models built using state‐of‐the‐art concepts, i.e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mixed integer linear programming models or heuristics to determine the optimal work to be performed at predefined times in train schedules on assets considering asset specific characteristics,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dynamic Bayesian networks to predict the future asset states and their levels of uncertainty, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multivariate Kriging to ensure correct estimates of current asset states when there are incomplete data sets,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;include the automated transfer of asset and intervention specific information contained in multiple databases at specific time points to facilitate the running of the mathematical models to generate idealized windows for interventions, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;include the automated recalculation of the exact activities to ensure train schedule stability between the fixed windows, with increasing levels of exactitude as the windows near. STABILITY will enable a digital revolution in railway intervention planning that will help ensure
both train schedule stability and the maximum use of train schedule reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
