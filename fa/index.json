This is achieved by taking into account multiple features, such as the location of components on the infrastructure network, interdependencies between interventions, possible possession windows to execute interventions, the impact on service, failure risks, and budget. This facilitates informed decision-making and effective communication between managers. To show the usefulness of the methodology presented in the paper, two scenarios are considered: one that accounts for interdependencies between multicomponent interventions and another that does not. Currently, infrastructure managers often consider the interdependencies between interventions for the determination of intervention program, but they might neglect doing so when they deal with a complex railway network. Therefore, ignoring all interdependencies represents an extreme case where such considerations are absent. The results show that considering interdependencies improves the net benefit of executing multicomponent interventions by approximately 58%, i.e., 15 million monetary unit in the period between t=6 to t=10.\nAn example spatial-temporal overview of the first intervention group overlapped with the train timetable in the first year between t=11 and t=15 on weekly, and hourly basis respectively using asset level (a), (c), and using component level (b), (d) information ","date":1749081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"fa","lastmod":1749081600,"objectID":"788a83992deeabe6ee878bfe2fca6167","permalink":"https://hamedmehranfar.github.io/fa/publication/journal-article-7/","publishdate":"2025-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/fa/publication/journal-article-7/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper addresses the complex iterative process railway managers currently use to sequence necessary interventions 2-10 years in advance, which requires extensive knowledge of costs, service impacts, locations, and failure risks.
