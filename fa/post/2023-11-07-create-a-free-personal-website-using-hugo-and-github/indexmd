Since the beginning of my time at ETH, I decided to create a personal website for myself. I did try so many options such as forking and modifying GitHub webpages, using the web development tools websites like [Wix.com](https://www.wix.com/), etc. However, none of them offered the freedom and customization options I was looking for until I found out about [**`blogdown`**](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/blogdown/) package in [R](https://www.R-project.org/) (in [Rstudio](https://posit.co/) in fact) that uses [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) to build webpages. As a theme, then I decided to go with [research.dev](https://research.dev/) themes (formerly known as *Wowchemy*).
